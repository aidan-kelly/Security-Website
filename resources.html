            <h2>Books</h2>

            <p>
                The book that helped me learn what I currently know is <em>Hacking: The Art of 
                Exploitation</em> by Jon Erickson. The book dives straight into the C programming 
                language and a light introduction to x86 assembly. If you have no prior programming 
                experience, this book will be a very tough read. However if you stick with it you 
                will learn a lot. I recommend downloading the ISO of the CD that comes with the book 
                and trying all of the exercieses within a Virtual Machine. This will help you cemement 
                what you read in the book, into your head.

            <h2>YouTube Channels</h2>

            <p>
                If you are more of a visual learner, there are a multitude of YouTube channels 
                that can assist your learning. One of my favorites for this is LiveOverflow. His 
                earlier videos are introductions to binary exploitaiton and walk throughs of CTFs 
                while his newer work is a little more advanced. However even his newer more advanced 
                material is very well explained and benefitial.

            <p>
                Another solid channel is the Cyber Mentor. His content is more focused at those 
                interested in gaining a job in IT Security/Pentesting.
