            <h1>Format String Exploits</h1>   
            <p>
                Format string vulnerabilities present themselves due to improper use of the printf()
                function alongside with unchecked user input in the C programming language. Printf() 
                takes in a format string and an unlimited number of parameters that will be used by 
                the format string. A format string is simply a string that contains <em>format 
                specifiers</em> (these start with the '%' character) that tell the function how to 
                translate the data that corresponds. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is a table of format specifiers and what they do:
            </p>

            <table border="1">
                <tr class="table-row">
                    <th>Format Specifier</th>
                    <th>Function</th>
                </tr>

                <tr class="table-row">
                    <td>%d</td>
                    <td>Prints an integer.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr class="table-row">
                    <td>%u</td>
                    <td>Prints an unsigned integer.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr class="table-row">
                    <td>%f</td>
                    <td>Prints a double.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr class="table-row">
                    <td>%x</td>
                    <td>Prints a hexadecimal number.</td>
                </tr>

                <tr class="table-row">
                    <td>%n</td>
                    <td>Writes the number of characters that have been printed so far, to the memory address that corresponds.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                Here is the right way to print user input:
            </p>
            
            <div class="code-container">
                <pre>
printf("%s", input);</pre>
            </div>
            

            <p>
                And here is the wrong way to print user input:
            </p>

            <div class="code-container">
                <pre>
printf(input);</pre>
            </div>
            

            <p>
                The problem with this, is that the  user can input their own format string as 
                input, which can have unintended results. This is beacuse the format string tells 
                printf() how many parameters are expected. If you supply a format string that 
                has more format specifiers than it has parameters, printf() will print out 
                memory on the stack that is after the last given parameter. 
            </p>

            <h2>Example</h2>

            <div class="code-container">
                <pre>
printf("%s %s %s", string1, string2)</pre>
            </div>
            

            <p>
                The above code will print out string1, then string2, and then will print out whatever
                comes above string2 in memory. This can be used to leak information in memory that 
                the user is not supposed to be able to access.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also use format strings to write data using the %n format specifier. 
                Since %n writes to the next address it finds on the stack. An attacker is able 
                to use this to write arbitrary data to memory addresses that they are not supposed to be able 
                to access. This can lead to an attacker gaining control of the program/computer.
