        <h1>Buffer Overflows</h1>
        
        <p>
            Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data, often while moving it from one 
            section of a program to another. Buffer overflows can often be triggered by malformed 
            inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain 
            size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that 
            produces more data could cause it to write past the end of the buffer. For example if 
            you create a buffer of size 10 and you write 20 bytes of data to this buffer, your input 
            data will fill up the 10 bytes of the buffer and then write 10 more bytes to adjacent 
            memory. If this overwrites adjacent data or executable code, this may result in erratic 
            program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, and crashes. You 
            may have experienced this yourself if you have ever had a program seg fault on you. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Exploiting the behavior of a buffer overflow is a well-known security exploit. On many 
            systems, the memory layout of a program, or the system as a whole, is well defined. By 
            sending in data designed to cause a buffer overflow, it is possible to write into areas 
            known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code, or to selectively 
            overwrite data pertaining to the program's state, therefore causing behavior that was 
            not intended by the original programmer.
        </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>

        <p>
            The following C code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack:
        </p>

        <pre>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
    //create a buffer of size 5 bytes
    char buffer[5];

    //look for our input string
    if (argc < 2) 
    { 
            printf("strcpy() NOT executed....\n"); 
            printf("Syntax: %s <characters>\n", argv[0]); 
            exit(0); 
    } 

    //copy the input into the buffer
    //not checking to see if the input fits
    strcpy(buffer, argv[1]); 

    //print out the buffer
    printf("buffer content= %s\n", buffer); 

    return 0; 
}
        </pre>

        <p>
            In the code above we copy input from the command line into a buffer the size of 5 bytes.
            The problem is that we can supply input that is larger than 5 bytes and strcpy() will 
            copy it into the buffer regardless. What ends up happening is, the data we copy into buffer 
            will fill up the 5 bytes of buffer and then overflow into other memory addresses. 
        </p>

        <p>
            An attacker can exploit this due to how the function stack is laid out. 
        </p>

        <p>
            After buffer fills with the first 5 bytes of data, strcpy() will continue to copy our 
            input into the memory above the buffer. In the picture above, we will end up overwriting 
            the higher memory addresses.  
        </p>

        <p>
            If an attacker is able to overwrite the return address of a function with the address of 
            some shellcode that they control, they will be able to hijack control of the program. 
            Shellcode is precompiled code that is able to be executed. We can fill the buffer with 
            our shellcode, and then overwrite the return address to point directly at our shellcode. 
            Once the program returns, it will return to and execute our shellcode, giving us control 
            of the program.
