            <h1>Buffer Overflows</h1>
            
            <p>
                Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data, often while moving it from one 
                section of a program to another. Buffer overflows can often be triggered by malformed 
                inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain 
                size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that 
                produces more data could cause it to write past the end of the buffer. For example if 
                you create a buffer of size 10 and you write 20 bytes of data to this buffer, your input 
                data will fill up the 10 bytes of the buffer and then write 10 more bytes to adjacent 
                memory. If this overwrites adjacent data or executable code, this may result in erratic 
                program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, and crashes. You 
                may have experienced this yourself if you have ever had a program seg fault on you. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Exploiting the behavior of a buffer overflow is a well-known security exploit. On many 
                systems, the memory layout of a program, or the system as a whole, is well defined. By 
                sending in data designed to cause a buffer overflow, it is possible to write into areas 
                known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code, or to selectively 
                overwrite data pertaining to the program's state, therefore causing behavior that was 
                not intended by the original programmer.

            <h2>Example</h2>

            <p>
                The following C code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack:
            </p>

            <div class="code-container">
                <pre>
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
    {
        //create a buffer of size 5 bytes
        char buffer[5];

        //look for our input string
        if (argc < 2) 
        { 
                printf("Usage: %s (input)\n", argv[0]); 
                exit(0); 
        } 

        //copy the input into the buffer
        //not checking to see if the input fits
        strcpy(buffer, argv[1]); 

        //print out the buffer
        printf("buffer content= %s\n", buffer); 

        return 0; 
    }           </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                In the code above we copy input from the command line into a buffer the size of 5 bytes.
                The problem is that we can supply input that is larger than 5 bytes and strcpy() will 
                copy it into the buffer regardless. What ends up happening is, the data we copy into buffer 
                will fill up the 5 bytes of buffer and then overflow into other memory addresses. 
            </p>

            <p>
                An attacker can exploit this due to how the function stack is laid out. 
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img id="stack" src="stack.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                After buffer fills with the first 5 bytes of data, strcpy() will continue to copy our 
                input into the memory above the buffer. In the picture above, we will end up overwriting 
                the higher memory addresses.  
            </p>

            <p>
                If an attacker is able to overwrite the return address of a function with the address of 
                some shellcode that they control, they will be able to hijack control of the program. 
                Shellcode is precompiled code that is able to be executed. We can fill the buffer with 
                our shellcode, and then overwrite the return address to point directly at our shellcode. 
                Once the program returns, it will return to and execute our shellcode, giving us control 
                of the program. 
            </p>
